# Addon-generator
Addon Generator is an app that allows users to easily create Chrome extensions, also known as "add-ons." With this app, users can customize and generate their own add-ons to enhance and extend the functionality of their web browser. The app provides a user-friendly interface and a variety of options for creating and configuring add-ons, making it accessible for users of all skill levels.
