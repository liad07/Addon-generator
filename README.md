# Addon-generator
Addon Generator is an app that allows users to easily create Chrome extensions, also known as "add-ons." With this app, users can customize and generate their own add-ons to enhance and extend the functionality of their web browser. The app provides a user-friendly interface and a variety of options for creating and configuring add-ons, making it accessible for users of all skill levels. Once an add-on is generated, it can be easily installed and used in the Chrome browser to provide additional features and functionality.
